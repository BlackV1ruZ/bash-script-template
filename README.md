bash-script-template
====================

I write **Bash** scripts not infrequently and realised that I often copied a recent script whenever I started writing a new one. This provided me with a basic scaffold to work on and several useful helper functions I'd otherwise likely end up duplicating.

So rather than continually copying old scripts and flensing the irrelevant code I'm publishing a more formalised template for my own usage and anyone else who may find it helpful! Suggestions for improvements are most welcome.
